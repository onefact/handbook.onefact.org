This week, I found myself in the vibrant city of NYC, ready to embark on an incredible journey cycling through all five boroughs alongside @onefact_org during the renowned Five Boro Bike Tour.

Let me tell you a bit about One Fact. They are a remarkable tech non-profit, dedicated to advancing healthcare access and equity worldwide through open-source AI. With esteemed support from renowned institutions like Columbia, Stanford, and the NIH, they have garnered recognition for their groundbreaking work.

Personally, I am deeply motivated to pedal for this cause. I wholeheartedly believe in the immense potential of this moment in history, where technology can pave the way for remarkable advancements in healthcare. It's a chance to tackle health concerns head-on and make a tangible difference.

Drawing from my past research and experience as a psychologist, I am acutely aware of the significance of informed decision-making when it comes to healthcare. I've witnessed firsthand the power of knowledge in empowering individuals to take charge of their own well-being and advocate for themselves. It is crucial that we ensure everyone has access to the information they need to make informed choices about their health outcomes.

When you donate to One Fact, you're contributing to a cause that is actively working to transform our broken healthcare system. Your donations are not only tax-deductible but also directly contribute to One Fact's mission of effecting the change we desperately need. Together, we can make a tangible impact and create a future where healthcare is accessible and equitable for all.

Join me on this incredible journey by supporting One Fact and together let's make a lasting difference in the lives of individuals around the world.
