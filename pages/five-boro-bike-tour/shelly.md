I remember the day I first met Jaan. It was through my dear friend, YiLi. Instantly, I was taken by his warm nature, a kind, caring soul radiating with the drive to make a difference.

Jaan told me about his role at One Fact Foundation. The more he spoke, the clearer his dedication became. It was as if his words were painting a vivid picture of a mission that was larger than life.

Being a part of something big, something meaningful, stirred a desire within me. I found myself longing to lend my support, to contribute to Jaan's cause. The vision he shared wasn't just about One Fact Foundation, it was about making an impact, creating a ripple effect of change.

And so, I decided to join in. Not just to support Jaan, but to help make One Fact Foundation a resounding success. With every pedal stroke, every mile covered, I know we're making a difference, together. 

Join us, won't you? Because every action, no matter how small, contributes to a larger cause. Your support matters. Your journey with us matters. 

Here's to us, the changemakers, one pedal stroke at a time.
