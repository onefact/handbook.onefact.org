## What we need from you to post your rider webpage

Please email the following to [bike@onefact.org](bike@onefact.org):

1. A photo of yourself that you love
2. A few sentences (or as long as you want!) about why you want to help us fundraise. 

We'll post these on your rider page.

(A potential starting prompt: what is one fact that has led to meaningful change in your life or the world around you? Or give ChatGPT a try if you have writer's block ;)

You can see an example of a rider page here:
