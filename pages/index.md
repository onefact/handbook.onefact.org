> Our non-profit structure allows our partners, such as the National Institutes of Health and Harvard Medical School, to grant access to the health data needed to build, train, and deploy our AI engine, ClinicalBERT. Releasing and conducting research using this open source AI means we can require enterprises using our tech to validate their deployments of our model against state-of-the-art health equity metrics.
